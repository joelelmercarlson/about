Dear Candidate

Thank you for applying to the Associate Linux Support Engineer position
at the Consultancy.

We do things a little differently! A senior team of managers and leaders
from across the company form a virtual team of hiring leads to shepherd
every application through our process. They are not recruiters, they run
some aspect of the business, and we trust them to keep your interests
and our business goals in mind and to find great opportunities in the
Consultancy for the very best applicants around the world. You can
email them a question, but we ask that you be gentle on their inboxes,
and direct your questions to interviewers you meet along the way.

The hiring lead for this role should review your resume quickly, and
decide whether to get you started on this role, or perhaps whether
a different role might be a better fit. You can at any time choose to
pursue multiple opportunities at the Consultancy, although you will need
to keep track of multiple parallel requests for interview availability.

For reference, our interview process starts with a written interview,
which will be reviewed in an anonymized queue to reduce bias, and
a standardised assessment of aptitude and personality, to provide a
more objective initial application review. Your hiring lead will move
you through the process. At some stage you will have an interview
with our Talent team to discuss things like employment terms. First,
we try to establish if you will be a great fit at the Consultancy,
and we may suggest you look at a different role to this one after the
initial batch of conversations. Once your course is set, you will meet
the hiring manager for that particular role. We may finish the process
with a panel interview for shortlisted candidates.

As you move through the process you will receive a series of
communications from us. These will come directly from our Applicant
Tracking System, our partner providers or as an email from your hiring
lead here.

Our mission is to deliver the world's best open source experience, from
public cloud to tiny devices, and to support the work of developers all
around the world who are inventing the future, from autonomous vehicles
to artificial intelligence, on every conceivable architecture and class
of compute.

Regards,
The Consultancy
